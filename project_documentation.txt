  * Regime stability

2.3 LSTM Regime Prediction
- Deep learning model for predicting market regimes
- Architecture:
  * LSTM layers with dropout (0.2)
  * Multi-head attention mechanism (4 heads)
  * Fully connected layers with ReLU activation
- Features:
  * Price-based: returns, volatility, trends
  * Volume-based: intensity, changes, volatility
  * Technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
  * Sequence length: 30 time steps
